## Overview

V-OADRS stands for Vision-based Object Anomaly Detection Robotic System, a special purpose robotic system designed for Acme Robotics, for their future product line. With the changing trend in manufacturing industries for theadoption of autonomous processes, the V-OADRS system can fill the gaps for autonomous inspection toachieve desired quality standards. This robotic system is mainly designed for plastic product manufacturing industries. V-OADRS will scan and inspect the object placed in the defined workspace of the robot, on an assumedwell-defined inspection location or fixture, for proper relative orientation of an object with respect to thearm manipulator (having a scanner mounted on it).
 The system can be programmed to detect any user-defined anomaly (based on the quality needs).  For demonstration, we will detect the presence of a definednumber of holes and their diameters as a quality checkpoint on an object.V-OADRS will generate an output highlighting the number of holes detected and the diameter of each.It will also tell if the diameter of the holes is in the (predefined) acceptable range or not.

## Dependencies

To install and use this package successfully, you need to have all the following dependencies installed on your machine.
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ros kinetic
* Gazebo 7.0
* OpenCV 3.3.0
* ROS-Industrial Universal Robot package

You can follow official ubuntu guidelines provided [here](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop-1604#0) to install Ubuntu 16.04 on your local machine. Though virtual machine can be used, but we highly recommend local installation for better performance with gazebo simulation

Follow official ROS installation guidelines provided [here](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation) to install ROS kinetic.

To install gazebo 7.0 follow [this](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu&ver=7.0&cat=install) instructions. 

Install OpenCV 3.3.0 refer [this](https://medium.com/@Linh.NG/installing-opencv-3-3-0-on-ubuntu-16-04-lts-7db376f93961) page.


## Technology Used

## Development Process
Agile iterative process is being followed for project. The roles were divided into driver and navigator, which were shuffled as per tasks. You can find all iteration and products logs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnU5e_QEPwAU8ns-pFhITGS3_m1YnjaZeSdVSFJj3gg/edit#gid=0).
